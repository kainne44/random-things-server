This is a rust web server for generating random numbers, passwords, and dice rolls. User can specify the length of their number or password, and the quantity of dice and sides.

The intent is to use this as the backend to a full stack web service built in rust.

The program is not production ready yet, as it only runs on localhost right now.

TODO: 
1. Productionize the server
2. Create a frontend for the server
3. Update server routes
4. Refactor to handle input errors
